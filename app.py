    "Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, arising from the "
    "accumulation of lipid-based reactive oxygen species when glutathione-dependent "
    "repair systems are compromised. Lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial impairment and "
    "iron dyshomeostasis are the hallmark of ferroptosis, which is emerging as a "
    "crucial player in neurodegeneration. This review provides an analysis of the "
    "most recent advances in ferroptosis, with a special focus on Friedreich's Ataxia "
    "(FA), the most common autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, caused by "
    "reduced levels of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur "
    "cluster synthesis and antioxidant defenses. The hypothesis is that the "
    "iron-induced oxidative damage accumulates over time in FA, lowering the "
    "ferroptosis threshold and leading to neuronal cell death and, at last, to "
    "cardiac failure. The use of anti-ferroptosis drugs combined with treatments "
    "able to activate the antioxidant response will be of paramount importance in FA "
    "therapy, such as in many other neurodegenerative diseases triggered by "
    "oxidative stress."
